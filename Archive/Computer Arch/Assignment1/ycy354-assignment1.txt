1. Which lines of code correspond to the for loop of foo?

.L3:
	mov	eax, DWORD PTR [ebp-4]
	mov	DWORD PTR [ebp-56+eax*4], 5
	add	DWORD PTR [ebp-4], 1
.L2:
	cmp	DWORD PTR [ebp-4], 12
	jle	.L3
	mov	eax, DWORD PTR [ebp-4]
	leave
	ret

2. Which register is used to hold the variable i of foo?
eax register hold the variable i 
Reason: mov	eax, DWORD PTR [ebp-4] load the mamory address [ebp-4] to the register eax.

3. What is the memory address of the variable i of foo?
[ebp-4]

4. What is the beginning address of array B?
[ebp-56]

From:
[ebp-56+eax*4] (B[i]) and eax*4 is [i], so the [ebp-56] is the beginning address.

5. What is the addressing mode for the constant BUF_SIZE when it is used as loop bound?
Immediate Mode, since number is encode in the instruction.

6. What is the addressing mode for the constant 5?
Immediate Mode

7. What is the addressing mode used to access each element of B in the loop?
Scaled Mode since eax*4 is the Scaled

8. What does the code on line 9 (“sub esp, 64”) do?
subtracts 64 bytes from register "esp", provided space for other variable.
