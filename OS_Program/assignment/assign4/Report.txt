I could see there is a big difference between one and two thread. The algro gained improvement through the muti thread. But before I fix the problem in C (I did not pass the size n in the struct, now I added it in the struct), it keep getting seg fault, and in Java it do not have this problem since it is easier to use thread.
Through coding, Java is easier to implement since it could pass the class to the thread, and the way C did is kind of long and complicated. But I could see that the struct is just another "low level" class and basically have the same function in this project.
